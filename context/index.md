# <PROJECT> Knowledge Bundle

Agent-facing knowledge base for this project, in
[OKF](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md)
v0.1. The agent owns this directory; humans curate sources and direct the work.

Read [`CONVENTIONS.md`](./CONVENTIONS.md) before ingesting or editing.

## Bundle guide

* [Conventions](./CONVENTIONS.md) — frontmatter, types, linking, ingest/query/lint rules.
* [Why these rules](./workflow-rationale.md) — the failure mode behind each
  planning-hygiene rule in `CLAUDE.md`. Read before relaxing one.

## References

_(`type: Reference` — synthesis of an external source, citing the immutable original in `../references/`.)_

<!-- * [Some Spec](./some-spec.md) — one-line summary. -->

## Concepts

_(`type: Concept` — durable domain / design knowledge.)_

## Components

_(`type: Component` — modules / subsystems of the project.)_

## Decisions

_(`type: Decision` — ADRs: the *why* of resolved forks.)_

* [Decisions register](./decisions/index.md) — ADRs grouped under `decisions/`.

<!-- [EXAMPLE] The sections above are empty on purpose. As you ingest sources and
     make decisions, add one bullet per concept here, grouped by type. -->
