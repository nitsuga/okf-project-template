# Why these rules

The hygiene rules in [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) § Planning hygiene look fussy
until you've watched docs rot. **Read this before relaxing one** — each earned its
place by a failure mode:

- **One job per doc.** When two docs narrate the same thing, one copy drifts and
  you can't tell which is right. So: history lives only in `log.md`, the decided
  register only in `decisions/index.md`, present state only in `PROGRESS.md`.
- **History → `log.md`, present-state → `PROGRESS.md`.** A curated knowledge base
  must not carry volatile session history, and a status doc must not accrete a
  "Done" pile. Keeping them separate keeps each trustworthy.
- **Docs land in the *same commit* as the code.** A doc updated "later" is a doc
  that is wrong in between — and agents, reviewers, and your future self all read
  the repo *at a commit*, not at "later". Deferring also means reconstructing what
  changed from memory, so the entry arrives thin or never arrives at all. So the
  commit that changes behaviour carries its own `log.md` + `PROGRESS.md` update;
  the checklist at the top of `CLAUDE.md` is the gate that enforces it.
- **No live tallies.** A count ("19 tests", "forks 1–15") is wrong the moment the
  next change lands, and nobody remembers to update prose numbers. Describe the
  *state* ("all tests green", "none open — see the register"); a number is only
  ever a frozen snapshot in a dated `log.md` line.
- **Closing scrubs the future / one home for open work.** Forward-looking content
  drifts exactly like history: resolve an item but leave it listed under "Next" /
  "candidate" elsewhere, and the docs now lie. So a candidate lives in *one* place
  (ROADMAP's backlog), and resolving it means deleting its forward-looking
  mentions too — not just updating the present-state bullet.
- **Lint is the backstop.** Nothing fires it automatically, so run it periodically
  (closing a fork, before a release). But the real lever is reducing what *can*
  drift (the rules above), so the lint has little to catch.

The meta-lesson: **duplication rots — in both tenses.** Most of these rules are
one idea (don't say the same thing in two places) applied to the past (history,
decisions) and the future (open/candidate work).

This file is the single home for that rationale. It lives in `context/` — not the
top-level `README.md` — so the project's README stays human-facing: what the
project is, how to build it, how it's laid out. See
[`CONVENTIONS.md`](./CONVENTIONS.md) § Layout for the directory taxonomy.
