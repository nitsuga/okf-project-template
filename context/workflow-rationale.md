# Why these rules

The hygiene rules in [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) § Planning hygiene look fussy
until you've watched docs rot. **Read this before relaxing one** — each earned its
place by a failure mode, and the ones marked *observed* were paid for in a real
project built from this template, not imagined:

- **One job per doc.** When two docs narrate the same thing, one copy drifts and
  you can't tell which is right. So: history lives only in `log.md`, the decided
  register only in `decisions/index.md`, present state only in `PROGRESS.md`.
- **History → `log.md`, present-state → `PROGRESS.md`.** A curated knowledge base
  must not carry volatile session history, and a status doc must not accrete a
  "Done" pile. Keeping them separate keeps each trustworthy.
- **Docs land in the *same commit* as the code.** A doc updated "later" is a doc
  that is wrong in between — and agents, reviewers, and your future self all read
  the repo *at a commit*, not at "later". Deferring also means reconstructing what
  changed from memory, so the entry arrives thin or never arrives at all. So the
  commit that changes behaviour carries its own `log.md` + `PROGRESS.md` update;
  the checklist at the top of `AGENTS.md` is the gate that enforces it.
- **No live tallies.** A count ("19 tests", "forks 1–15") is wrong the moment the
  next change lands, and nobody remembers to update prose numbers. Describe the
  *state* ("all tests green", "none open — see the register"); a number is only
  ever a frozen snapshot in a dated `log.md` line.
- **Closing scrubs the future / one home for open work.** Forward-looking content
  drifts exactly like history: resolve an item but leave it listed under "Next" /
  "candidate" elsewhere, and the docs now lie. *Observed*: ROADMAP and PROGRESS
  both carried candidate lists, so resolved forks survived in whichever copy
  nobody happened to be editing. So a candidate lives in *one* place (ROADMAP's
  backlog), and resolving it means deleting its forward-looking mentions too —
  not just updating the present-state bullet.
- **"Now" is where the *work* is, not what the system *does*.** Present state
  attracts capability description — "the parser handles X, the backend supports
  Y" — because that is true right now. But it is durable knowledge, owned by a
  `context/` concept or an ADR, and PROGRESS re-narrating it is the same
  duplication in a costume. *Observed*: in both projects built from this
  template, "Now" grew past 75 lines of feature inventory, each block restating
  an ADR it also linked. It grows without bound because nothing ever prompts you
  to *delete* a capability — unlike a task, which closing removes. The test is in
  `PROGRESS.md`: if a sentence would still be true after a month of no work, it
  is knowledge, not status.
- **Lint is the backstop.** Nothing fires it automatically, so run it periodically
  (closing a fork, before a release). But the real lever is reducing what *can*
  drift (the rules above), so the lint has little to catch.

The meta-lesson: **duplication rots — in every tense.** Most of these rules are
one idea (don't say the same thing in two places) applied to the past (history,
decisions), the future (open/candidate work), and the timeless (what the system
does — knowledge, not status).

**Add your own scars.** When one of these rules fails *here* — you find the
stale claim, the orphaned "Next", the tally nobody updated — append a one-line
*observed* origin to the matching bullet, naming what actually drifted. A rule
carrying a concrete incident survives the first time it is inconvenient; a rule
that reads as general principle gets deleted. This is the one place in the
workflow where accumulating history is correct: these are the reasons, not the
chronology, so they belong here rather than in [`log.md`](./log.md).

This file is the single home for that rationale. It lives in `context/` — not the
top-level `README.md` — so the project's README stays human-facing: what the
project is, how to build it, how it's laid out. See
[`CONVENTIONS.md`](./CONVENTIONS.md) § Layout for the directory taxonomy.
